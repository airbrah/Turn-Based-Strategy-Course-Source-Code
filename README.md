# Turn-Based-Strategy-Course-Source-Code
 This is my current source code to the GameDev.tv Team course "Unity Turn-Based Strategy Game: Intermediate C# Coding".
 
 Project: https://airwick0.itch.io/turn-based-strategy-course-project
 
The lessons taught in this course were:
- creating custom grid systems
- C# generics
- C# events
- Custom structs
- A* pathfinding

After completing the course, I implemented more features of my own to make the project alot more player/user engaging.

This includes:
- Adding audio to approriate areas to make the world feel alive
- Improving the AI scoring system to work along with A* pathfinding movement
- Improving how unit ragdolls are handled
- Damage indicators
- Adding an end game scene with implemented custom loader
- Adding custom units and giving them unquie actions
