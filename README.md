# Turn-Based-Strategy-Course-Source-Code
 This is my current source code to the GameDev.tv Team course "Unity Turn-Based Strategy Game: Intermediate C# Coding".
 
The lessons taught in this course were:
-creating custom grid systems
-C# generics
-C# events
-custom structs
-A* pathfinding

After completing the course, I implemented more features of my own to make the project alot more player/user engaging.
This includes:
-Adding audio to approriate areas to make the world feel alive
-improving the AI scoring system to work along with A* pathfinding movement
-improving how unit ragdolls are handled
-damage indicators
-adding an end game scene with implemented custom loader
-adding custom units and giving them unquie actions
